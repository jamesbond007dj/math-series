# math-series

**Author**: James Bond (ilker Zaimoglu)
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Write one function for Fibonaci number serie and another function for Lucas number serie to get the number at the requested index number by using Python language and test these 2 functions by pytest.Then adding third sum_series function with 2 optinal parameters 0 and 2 for calling this function without parameters Fibonacci serie and parameters 2 and 1 calling this fuction without parameters Lucas series.

## Getting Started
1. Create a basic function for index 0 for Fibonaci and Lucas Series and test index 0.
2. Add if statement for index 1 for Fibonaci and Lucas Series and test index 1.
3. Add if statement for index 2 for Fibonaci and Lucas Series and test index 2.
4. Add if statement for index > 2 for Fibonaci and Lucas Series and test several indexes > 2.
5. Add if statements for index < 0 for Fibonaci and Lucas Series and test several indexes < 2.
6. Big numbers are blocked the test so I skip the tests of big numbers.
7. Sum_series function created with 2 optional parameters default values calling the series without arguments and test them.

## Architecture
Python language used for the fuctions. Pipenv Shell envirement created for tests. Pytest is used testing the functions.

## API
Recursive solution method is used for funtions of Fibunaci and Lucas series. This method is very clear and easy to understand and one to one same as the math sequences. The test are math according Fibonacci and Lucas series, however there negaFibonacci and negaLucas number series.Negative index number series are negleted.

## Change Log
12-03-2019 2:00pm - Fibonacci function created and first test is done.
12-03-2019 2:30pm - Fibonacci function test skipped for big numbers.
12-03-2019 3:30pm - Fibonacci function negative index test completed.
12-03-2019 4:30pm - Lucas function and tests are completed similiar way of Fibonacci funtcion and tests.
12-03-2019 5:30pm - Sum-series function and tests of it are completed similiar way of previous functions and tests.
